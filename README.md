Objective:

The goal of this capstone project is to apply all core Java concepts, including object-oriented programming, collections, exception handling, file handling, and more, by building a fun and interactive application. You will design and implement a Pet Adoption Center system that allows users to manage pets, adopt them out to new owners, and maintain records of available pets. This project will showcase your ability to create a well-structured Java application with real-world utility and fun elements.

Problem Statement:

Design a Pet Adoption Center system that allows staff to manage pet records, track adoptions, and provide potential adopters with information about available pets. The program must be user-friendly, handle errors gracefully, and offer a delightful experience for users looking to adopt their next furry friend.

Requirements:

Classes and Object-Oriented Concepts:

    Create a class Pet with attributes such as petId, name, species, age, breed, and adoptionStatus.
    Design a class Adopter with attributes like adopterId, name, contactInfo, and adoptedPets (stored in a collection).
    Implement a class PetAdoptionCenter that holds collections of pets and adopters, providing methods to manage them.
    Utilize inheritance to create subclasses (e.g., Dog, Cat, Bird) that extend the Pet class with additional attributes or behaviors.
    Apply polymorphism by using common interfaces for different actions (e.g., Adoptable, Vaccinable).

Key Features:

    Adding and Managing Pets: Create methods to add new pets, update their information, mark them as adopted, and remove pets from the system.
    Adoption Process: Allow adopters to view available pets, select a pet to adopt, and register as the new owner, updating the pet’s adoption status.
    Search and Filter Pets: Implement features to search for pets based on species, age, breed, or availability, making it easy for users to find their perfect match.
    Exception Handling: Handle errors such as invalid pet data, incorrect input, or issues during the adoption process using custom exceptions where appropriate.

Implementation:

Write a main class AdoptionApp with a main method to demonstrate the functionality of your Pet Adoption Center. Implement methods to:

    Add new pets to the center and update their information.
    Register adopters and allow them to adopt pets.
    Manage pet adoption statuses, ensuring that each pet can only be adopted once.
    Save and load data to/from files to maintain a record of all pets and adopters.

Sample Output:

The main method should demonstrate the following scenarios:

    Adding new pets and displaying available ones.
    Registering new adopters and completing adoption transactions.
    Searching for pets by criteria (e.g., species, age) and displaying the results.
    Handling errors gracefully (e.g., trying to adopt a pet that’s already been adopted).
    Saving the system’s state to a file and reloading it on program restart.
